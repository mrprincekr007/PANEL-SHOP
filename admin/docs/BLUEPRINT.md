# NEXUS ADMIN PANEL — COMPLETE PROJECT DOCUMENTATION

## WHAT IS THIS PROJECT
Admin dashboard for managing the user store. Admins can manage users, products (panels), payments (auto/manual/crypto), purchases, coupons, promotions, branding, support tickets, and site settings. All data is stored in Firebase Realtime Database.

## HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS — COMPLETE FLOW

### 1. ADMIN LOGIN
```
→ Visit admin panel URL → login page loads
→ Enter admin email + password
→ signInWithEmailAndPassword() called
→ isAdmin(uid) checks: (a) matches hardcoded ADMIN_UID? (b) exists in /admins/ node?
→ If not admin → sign out + show error
→ If admin → redirect to /pages/dashboard/dashboard.html
→ "Remember Me" saves email + password in localStorage
```

### 2. EVERY PAGE LOADS
```
→ assertAdmin() runs on DOMContentLoaded:
   1. Wait for auth state
   2. If user not logged in → redirect to login page
   3. If user logged in → isAdmin() check
   4. If not admin → sign out + redirect to login
   5. If admin → allow page to load, run page code
```

### 3. DASHBOARD
```
→ Real-time stats from Firebase:
   - Total Revenue: sum of approved gateway + manual deposits
   - Total Users: /users node size
   - Pending Manual: count of /manual_deposits where status="pending"
   - Pending Gateway: count of /gateway_payments where status="pending"
→ Revenue Chart (last 7 days): Chart.js loaded dynamically
→ Recent Deposits: last 5 gateway payments sorted by timestamp
```

### 4. PAYMENT APPROVAL FLOW (Gateway/Manual/Crypto)
```
→ Admin opens gateway/manual/crypto page
→ Table shows all payments with pending ones highlighted
→ Click "Accept":
   1. Confirm dialog
   2. Update deposit record status → "approved"
   3. runTransaction: add amount to user's /users/{uid}/balance
   4. Update /transactions/{uid}/{txId} status → "success"
   5. Credit referral commission (5% to referrer)
   6. logAudit() record created
   7. Toast notification shown
→ Click "Reject":
   1. Update deposit record status → "rejected"
   2. Update transaction status → "failed"
   3. logAudit() record created
```

### 5. USER MANAGEMENT
```
→ Table shows all users with their balance, status, join date
→ Search by name/email/UID
→ Edit Balance: modal with Add/Deduct/Set options
   - Amount validated (must be positive number)
   - Transaction record created in /transactions/{uid}
   - logAudit() records the change
→ Ban/Unban: update /users/{uid}/status
```

### 6. PANEL MANAGEMENT
```
→ Add Panel: form with name, logo, YouTube, links, descriptions, pricing plans
   - YouTube URL auto-parsed to extract video ID
   - Live preview card updates on input
   - Validates required fields + at least one plan
→ Manage Panels: grid view, enable/disable toggle, edit modal, delete with confirm
→ Categories: add/edit/delete, shows panel count per category
```

### 7. COUPONS & PROMOTIONS
```
→ Coupons: code, discount %, max usage, enable/disable
   - Code auto-capitalized
   - Validates no duplicate codes
   - Users apply coupon at checkout for discount
→ Promotions: title, description, discount %, image, link, enable/disable
   - Shows on user home page as carousel
   - Branding page also creates /global_alerts/promotions entry
```

### 8. TICKET SYSTEM
```
→ Real-time ticket list from /tickets node
→ Shows: priority badge, category, subject, user info, status
→ Reply to ticket: type message → saved as adminReply
   - Notification sent to user (pushed to /notifications/{uid})
→ Close ticket: status = "closed"
→ Tickets sorted: open first, then by date
```

## FIREBASE SECURITY RULES

File: `docs/firebase/Rules.md` — Copy this to Firebase Console → Realtime Database → Rules

### Key Rules:
- Only admin (UID: PmgO7qHYasOdgQfkmai0YnpQIWB3) can write to /panels, /categories, /promotions, /coupons, /settings, /audit_log
- Users can read/write only their own data under /users/{uid}, /transactions/{uid}, /purchases/{uid}
- Deposits (gateway/manual/crypto) can be created by any authenticated user, but only admin can change status
- .validate rules ensure: correct data types, positive amounts, valid status values (pending/approved/rejected)
- "$other" catch-all at root blocks any undeclared paths

---

## CODE ARCHITECTURE

### Firebase Access Pattern
```
Every page → imports from assets/scripts/firebase.js (single source of truth)
→ Uses: ref(), get(), set(), update(), remove(), push(), onValue(), runTransaction()
→ All Firebase operations wrapped in try/catch with toast error messages
```

### Admin Check Pattern
```
Every page → runs assertAdmin() on load
→ assertAdmin waits for Firebase Auth state
→ Calls isAdmin(uid) which checks:
   1. uid === hardcoded ADMIN_UID
   2. OR exists in /admins/{uid} node
→ If fails → signOut + redirect to login
→ If passes → page code executes
```

### Audit Logging
```
logAudit(action, details) called on every admin action:
- Balance edits, user bans, payment approvals/rejections, etc.
- Logs to /audit_log/{autoId} with action, details, adminUID, timestamp
```

### Badge System
```
badges.js uses onValue listeners to track:
- Pending gateway payments
- Pending crypto deposits
- Pending manual deposits
- Open tickets
- New users (since last seen)
Each admin page calls markSeen('page_name') on load to reset its badge
```

---

## IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES

1. Firebase API key is client-side. MUST restrict by HTTP referrer in Firebase Console.
2. To change admin: update ADMIN_UID in firebase.js AND Rules.md.
   OR add new UID to /admins/ node in Firebase Database (no code change needed).
3. auth-guard.js protects every page — unauthorized access redirects to login.
4. All admin actions are logged to /audit_log for accountability.

---

## BUILD & DEPLOY

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Minify JavaScript (after editing .js files)
node tools/build.js   # (note: tools/ folder deleted, recreate if needed)

# Deploy to Firebase Hosting
firebase deploy

# Deploy only hosting
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

---

## ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT

### Creating a new admin:
1. Firebase Console → Authentication → Add user (email + password)
2. Firebase Console → Realtime Database → /admins/ node → add {newUid: true}
3. Copy the new user's UID from Authentication section
4. Update ADMIN_UID in assets/scripts/firebase.js (or just add to /admins/ node)
5. Update docs/firebase/Rules.md with new UID (or keep both)
